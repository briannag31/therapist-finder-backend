    description: "Welcome, and thank you for taking the first steps towards healing, it's a beautiful, eye opening journey. I chose this line of work to provide others with the skills they need for walking their life path with their heads held high and love in their hearts. At some point we are all given difficult, transformative opportunities. I would be grateful to assist in honoring life's painful experiences and integrating them as they transform you into something greater. As a yoga teacher, therapist, and spiritual seeker I use healing modalities that shift the mind, body, and soul.\\n\\ My care will provide a safe space to cultivate an understanding of the symptoms present and how they fit into your life story. I will introduce tools to alleviate and integrate symptoms. These tools will be life longs skills that leave you feeling empowered at life's twists and turns.\\n\\ I find stimulating the mind, giving the body a voice, and listening to the soul to be the three most important components of healing. Each session will incorporate techniques for relaxing the body, talk therapy for stimulating the mind, and ritual for getting in touch with the soul. I graduated from Regis University it 2014 and completed my 200 hour yoga teacher training in 2012. Healing and spirituality have always gone hand in hand for me. Since 2014 I have been in private practice using my holistic approaches to healing. Over time I found my niche and began creating programs for women to feel empowered and step into their Divine Feminine Essence. I have created programs and memberships for women to continue their studies of the Divine Feminine which include: healing your body image, practicing self love, creating relationship with your heart and womb space, following your dreams, and living a life of joy and bliss. I also have plenty of male clients, I find my male clients enjoy calling in their Divine Masculine and stepping up into the men they have always wanted to be. In this way, I have also become an empowerment coach and help people go after the lives they have always wanted.",

In some ways, the higher the intelligence, the more difficult it can be to work oneself out of emotional knots. Just feeling like a trusting person actually 'gets it' is half the battle.

    description: "In dealing with stressors, life events, challenging relationships, and traumatic experiences we develop patterns to keep ourselves safe and sane; which often also limits us. The challenge is unlearning these narratives and trusting our innate wisdom. When we feel safe, secure and accepted for who we are we can begin the process of shedding what doesn't work for us, while exploring our untapped potential. I believe you are the master of your story; and I hope to create a safe space where we can gain insight about your inner battles, develop skills to enhance holistic development, and realize the potential of your authentic self.I have experience and interest in working with adults who struggle with anxiety, depression, history of trauma, relationships, substance use and abuse (including sex addiction), sexually deviant thoughts, sexual abuse, and sexual intimacy. I welcome anyone struggling with issues of identity, including gender, sexuality, race, culture and nationality. I wholeheartedly empathize with the challenge of seeking therapy, especially when this your first time reaching out. I believe a therapeutic alliance is unique in its scope, and is based on trust, understanding and mutual respect for each other's autonomy. I hope to create a safe and inviting space where I can foster a supportive therapeutic relationship.",

Sometimes it feels like you have to learn how to 'do life' all over again. It can be draining, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. My work is to support you in facing the darkness and encourage you to keep on growing into the best possible version fo your life. Whether it's a new city, job or career, new adulthood or retirement, or starting over after a loss—I'm here to lovingly guide you through it with empathy, accountability, and kindness. I'm a holistic coach with a PhD in depth psychology and a conviction that connection has incredible power to help us heal and grow. I've been through many difficult transitions myself and I know how hard it can be to start over. I rarely had the support I needed during the hard times and it has become my mission as a coach to now offer that support to you.",

    description: "One of the strongest choices you can make is to ask for help when you really need it. Connecting with an objective, non-judgmental person can help you from feeling stuck as you find answers to questions like: How do I deal with a complicated relationship? What is my true calling? How do I navigate my way through anxiety, stress, depression and addiction? Why do I keep making the same old choices? What do I need to do to feel better? Therapy is a profound step in creating the clarity you're seeking to lead a more stable, sustainable life. In the therapy room, I present myself as a real person you get to know over time, as you develop new insights, change negative patterns and grow more comfortable with who you are. I practice in a conversational way, offering thoughtful questions and useful interpretations, as we collaborate on solutions.",
